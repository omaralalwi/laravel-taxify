### calculate tax for an amount:

- use `calculateTax` to get Tax As object (default).

```php
$amount = 250;
$taxAmount = calculateTax($amount,'profileName')->tax_amount; // 37.5
````

---

**Another way to get Detailed Result**.

$amount = 250;
$tax = calculateTax($amount,'profileName');
```
Result (Object)
```php
 $tax = {
    "amount_with_tax": 287.5,
    "tax_amount": 37.5,
    "tax_rate": 0.15,
  }
```
---

**Another way**  you can pass $asArray (third param) as true to get result as array
```php
$amount = 250;
$tax = calculateTax($amount,'profileName',true);
```
Result
```
$tax = [
    "amount_with_tax" => 287.5,
    "tax_amount" => 37.5,
    "tax_rate" => 0.15,
  ]

```php
$amount = 250;
$taxAmount = calculateTax($amount,'',true)['tax_amount'];
```

**Note**: the second param refer to profile, we mad it null to take default profile, second param can take (`default`, null,''') all three values mean `default`.

### Calculate tax for a collection of amounts:

like calculateTax but this for a many amounts .

- use `calculateTaxForCollection` to get a tax for a collection of amounts by passing amounts as array (first param) -> Result wanted as object (default).

```php
// you can pass number as float or integer
$productAmount = 250;
$featureAmount = 70.5;
$sarrantyAmount = 30.60;
$chargeAmount = 90;

$tax = calculateTaxForCollection([$productAmount,$featureAmount, $sarrantyAmount, $chargeAmount]);
```
Result (object)
```php
$tax = {
    "amount_with_tax": 507.265,
    "tax_amount": 66.165,
    "tax_rate": 0.15,
  }
```
```php
$taxAmount = $tax->tax_amount // 507.265
```

to get a tax for a collection of amounts as array result , just pass third param as `true` like this.

```php
$tax = calculateTaxForCollection([$productAmount,$featureAmount, $sarrantyAmount, $chargeAmount],'',true);
```
Result (array)
```php
$tax = [
    "amount_with_tax" => 507.265,
    "tax_amount" => 66.165,
    "tax_rate" => 0.15,
  ]
```

### Get Tax Amount as numeric value

- use `getTaxAmount` to get Tax Amount as number

```php
$amount = 250;
getTaxAmount($amount); // Result 25
```

---

### Get tax rate or tax amount:

- use `getTaxRate` to get Tax Rate or amount (according to tax type for specified profile in config file)

```php
getTaxRate()
// Result 0.15
```

```php
getTaxRate('sales') // fore specific profile
// Result 50 , here the result is fixed number because the profile type is fixed amount Not percentage
```

if profile tax type is `fixed` will return the amount (read the tax rate as amount), else will return the tax rate.

**Note**: for default profile no need to pass `profileName.

---

### Get tax type:

```php
getTaxType('profileName')
// Result: fixed or percentage // depend on profile settings
```
